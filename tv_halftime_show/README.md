#Super Bowl tv and halftime show data

**project overview**

In this analysis, I imported, loaded, cleaned and explored _Super Bowl game, TV and halftime show data_. I visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. Then used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. 

**project finding**

Discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.
